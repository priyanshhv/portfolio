        <p class="mb-5">I am a PhD student specializing in structural engineering with a strong focus on applied
          mechanics
          problems.
          My research focuses on Phase Field Modeling of Brittle Fracture Involving Multiphysics in Non-Polar and
          Micro-Polar Solids.
          I have conducted extensive simulations that explore thermo-mechanical, electro-mechanical, and
          thermo-electro-mechanical
          fractures in both non-polar and micro-polar solids. My work also includes fracture modeling of
          high-performance
          ceramic
          laminates with tailored residual stress, as well as dynamic and impact fractures, fatigue failure,
          chemo-mechanical fractures
          like hydrogen embrittlement, and the failure of hyperelastic materials.
          For model implementation, I utilize the Gridap package in Julia.
          I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of applied mechanics and am open to research collaborationsâ€”feel
          free
          to reach out!

            <p>During my summer internship at a structural design firm, I gained valuable experience in structural
              engineering by
              engaging in a variety of responsibilities. I was involved in the comprehensive analysis of concrete
              structures,
              assessing their stability, durability, and compliance with safety standards. My role extended to the
              design

              where I contributed to the development and optimization of concrete structures at the Milan Mela Ground in
              Kolkata.
              This included working on load calculations, material selection, and ensuring that the designs met both
              functional and
              regulatory requirements. Through this internship, I enhanced my practical skills in structural analysis
              and
              design,
              while collaborating with a multidisciplinary team to deliver effective engineering solutions.

                <h3>A phase-field model for thermo-mechanical fracture</h3>
                <p>In this article, we propose a thermodynamically consistent phase-field model for thermo-mechanical
                  fracture and provide
                  an open-source implementation of the proposed model using a recently developed finite element toolbox,
                  Gridap in Julia.
                  Here, we have derived the balance equations for the thermo-mechanical fracture by invoking the virtual
                  power principle
                  and determined the constitutive relations for the thermodynamic fluxes based on the satisfaction of
                  the thermodynamic
                  laws. Our proposed formulation provides an equation of temperature evolution that can easily
                  accommodate dissipative
                  effects such as viscous damping. We provide very compact and user-friendly open-source codes for
                  implementing the
                  proposed model using Gridap in Julia that requires very low memory usage and gives a high degree of
                  flexibility to the
                  users in defining weak forms of the governing partial differential equations (PDEs). We have validated
                  the proposed
                  model and its implementation against such standard results available in the literature as crack
                  propagation in the
                  cruciform shape material, single edge notched plate, bi-material beam, and a quenching test.</p>

                <h3>A phase-field model for electro-mechanical fracture with an open-source implementation of it using
                  Gridap in Julia</h3>
                <p>In this paper, we propose a phase-field model for electro-mechanical fracture in brittle materials
                  and provide an
                  open-source implementation of the proposed model using a newly developed finite element (FE) toolbox,
                  Gridap in Julia.
                  Here, we have considered electric potential as an additional kinematic descriptor along with the
                  displacement and
                  phase-field variable. Using the virtual power principle, we have derived force balances for the
                  electro-mechanical
                  forces and a force balance associated with the damage. To incorporate the strong electro-mechanical
                  coupling effect into
                  the model, we have considered the Helmholtz free energy as a function of the electric field vector,
                  strain tensor,
                  phase-field variable, and the gradient of the phase-field variable. The proposed model ensures that
                  the constitutive
                  relations of the thermodynamic fluxes are on the satisfaction of the thermodynamic laws and can
                  readily accommodate
                  dissipative energy effects whenever needed. The proposed model provides complex crack paths as a
                  solution to the
                  governing partial differential equations (PDEs), and thus bypasses the need for re-meshing, enrichment
                  of FE shape
                  functions, and an explicit tracking of the crack surfaces. The use of Gridap makes the FE
                  implementation of the proposed
                  model exceedingly compact and user-friendly requiring very low memory usage and providing a high
                  degree of flexibility
                  to the users in defining weak forms of the governing PDEs. We have validated the proposed model and
                  its implementation
                  against a compact tension test on a single edge notched plate and a set of three-point bending tests
                  on a notched beam
                  made of lead zirconium titanate (PZT)-4 piezoelectric ceramics.</p>

                <h3>Combined diffused material interface and hybrid phase-field model for brittle fracture in
                  heterogeneous composites</h3>
                <p>In this article, we propose a novel approach for modeling brittle fracture in heterogeneous
                  composites using a combined
                  diffused material interface method and a hybrid phase-field model (PFM). We have used the diffused
                  material interface
                  method to derive analytical expressions for the regularized material properties across the material
                  interfaces that are
                  treated as an input to the PFM for the simulation of brittle fractures in composites. The use of
                  diffused material
                  interface method regularizes the material properties in such a way that one can avoid the
                  discontinuity in stress across
                  the material interface and thus bypass the requirement of explicit tracking of material interfaces for
                  finite element
                  implementation of the hybrid PFM. We have implemented the proposed combined model using a recently
                  developed open-source
                  finite element toolbox, Gridap in Julia. We have considered tests on a single circular fiber inclusion
                  under tension, a
                  bi-material rectangular plate under tension, single square inclusion under tensile loading, a notched
                  composite beam
                  with a central notch under symmetric three-point bending, and a rectangular plate with multiple fibers
                  under tensile
                  loading to show how the proposed combined model can be used to simulate brittle fracture in
                  composites.</p>

                  thermo-electro-mechanical
                  fracture</h3>
                <p>Using a volumetricâ€“deviatoric decomposition of strain, we propose a novel phase-field model for
                  thermo-electro-mechanical fracture and provide an open-source finite element implementation of the
                  proposed model.
                  Considering displacement, electric potential, temperature field, and phase-field variable, we have
                  obtained the
                  governing partial differential equations (PDEs), by utilizing the virtual power principle. We have
                  obtained the
                  constitutive relations for the necessary thermodynamic fluxes on satisfying the first and second laws
                  of thermodynamics.
                  The proposed model can accommodate any dissipative effect, such as viscous damping, whenever
                  necessary, in a
                  thermodynamically consistent manner. We have developed open-source finite element codes for the
                  proposed model using the
                  Gridap package in Julia. Here, we have used the proposed model for fracture simulation in transversely
                  isotropic
                  material and functionally graded material for compact tension and three-point bending tests. We have
                  considered
                  variations in thermal and electrical loading conditions and investigated the corresponding changes in
                  the structural
                  responses. For the functionally graded specimens, we have also considered the variation in the
                  material property
                  gradation directions, along with the thermal and electrical boundary conditions to evaluate their
                  effect on the
                  structural responses of specimens.</p>

                <h3>Two different micro-polar phase-field models for brittle fracture and their open-source finite
                  element implementation</h3>
                <p>Realizing the limitations of classical phase-field fracture models and the need for the development
                  of non-local
                  phase-field models that can capture the experimentally observed size effects in brittle and
                  quasi-brittle materials, we
                  propose thermodynamically consistent volumetric-deviatoric and spectral decomposition-based
                  phase-field models (PFMs)
                  for brittle fracture in micro-polar continua. For developing the proposed models, we have considered
                  the micro-rotation
                  as an additional kinematic descriptor, and have derived the balance equations by invoking the virtual
                  power principle.
                  On satisfying the thermodynamic laws, we have determined the constitutive relations for the
                  thermodynamic fluxes and
                  demonstrated that any dissipative effect can easily be incorporated into the proposed models. We have
                  provided an
                  open-source finite element (FE) implementation of the micro-polar PFMs using Gridap in Julia. The
                  implementation
                  includes various benchmark problems to illustrate how the responses in a specimen change with the
                  variations in
                  micro-polar material parameters. Through a series of numerical examples with different values of
                  micro-polar material
                  parameters, we have showcased both the capabilities and limitations of the proposed
                  volumetric-deviatoric and spectral
                  decomposition-based micro-polar PFMs.</p>

                  tailored residual
                  stresses on the mechanical performance of ceramic laminates</h3>
                <p>Ceramics offer several attractive properties of industrial relevance, e.g. high strength and
                  hardness, low thermal
                  conductivity, and chemical inertness in critical environments. There is thus interest among
                  researchers to improve the
                  fracture toughness of ceramics, which is generally low and considered a major drawback. Numerous
                  experimental studies in
                  the literature report on the enhancement of mechanical performance of ceramic laminates, especially
                  fracture toughness,
                  by tailoring the residual stress, resulting in crack deflection or bifurcation. However, there is a
                  dearth of
                  computational models that can reliably predict the crack path and accurately quantify the improved
                  fracture toughness.
                  In this article, we propose a residual stress-dependent mixed-mode phase-field model within a small
                  deformation set-up.
                  The proposed model is efficient in including any energy dissipation effect in a consistent manner. The
                  model can be
                  exploited as a tool to study the effect of tailored residual stresses on the fracture toughness of
                  ceramic laminates. We
                  have validated our proposal by reproducing the results for a few problems that require the
                  incorporation of residual
                  stresses within the formulation.</p>

                <h3>A phase-field length scale insensitive mode-dependent fracture model for brittle failure</h3>
                <p>This article presents a consistent phase-field length scale insensitive mode-dependent fracture model
                  for brittle
                  failure by proposing mode-factor dependent degradation functions that incorporate the effect of two
                  additional fracture
                  parameters, namely the mode-II critical energy release rate and mode-II fracture strength, on the
                  overall mechanical
                  response. Using the proposed mode-factor dependent degradation functions and employing a recently
                  proposed modified
                  strain decomposition scheme, we provide analytical expressions for the mode-I and mode-II fracture
                  strengths
                  corresponding to the mode-dependent parts of the elastic energy. Adopting a modified Benzeggaghâ€“Kenane
                  (Bâ€“K) criteria,
                  we propose mode-dependent driving forces by deriving expressions for the critical energy release rate
                  corresponding to
                  individual fracture modes. The proposed model provides a consistent coupling between the different
                  fracture modes and
                  can thus predict fracture for all possible mode-mixity ratios. A parametric study is carried out to
                  unravel the effect
                  of mixed-mode fracture parameters on the mechanical response of isotropic materials by considering a
                  few representative
                  numerical examples. The numerical results from the proposed model show an excellent agreement with
                  experimental results
                  reported in the literature.</p>
